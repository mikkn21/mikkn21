# Hi, I'm Mikkel üëãü™¥

I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). 
My main areas of interest are
- Algorithms,
- Programming languages,
- Software architecture,
- Graph Theory,
- Compiler design,
- DevOps.

My interest in DevOps is particularly driven by a passion for efficiency and automating workflows ‚Äì I believe in investing time now to save time forever!
Further, I'm fascinated with Graph theory and its application in real world problems.

As a fun side-challenge and perhaps another nod to efficiency, I also enjoy speed typing‚å®Ô∏è. I currently reach around 130 WPMüöÄ with [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY) and am in the process of learning the [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) layout to push that further.

### On this profile, you'll find:
*  üéì **Academic Explorations:** Code related to my university coursework and larger projects, demonstrating concepts I've learned and applied. This sometimes includes public versions of collaborative group work (see note below).
> [!NOTE]
> For some collaborative group projects (originally developed privately), I've created separate public repositories to share and document the work more thoroughly. In these public copies, I often add detailed README sections explaining the project's context and objectives and sometimes include relevant reports or documentation for completeness.
*  üí° **Personal Tinkering:** My personal playground! These repositories contain projects I build for fun, to learn something new (currently exploring C# and Raylib!), or to solve a small problem that bugs me.
