# Hi, I'm Mikkel 👋🪴

I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). 
My main areas of interest are
- Algorithms,
- Programming languages,
- Software architecture,
- Graph Theory,
- Compiler design,
- DevOps.

My interest in DevOps is particularly driven by a passion for efficiency and automating workflows – I believe in investing time now to save time forever!
Further, I'm fascinated with Graph theory and its application in real world problems.

As a fun side-challenge and perhaps another nod to efficiency, I also enjoy speed typing⌨️. I currently reach around 130 WPM🚀 with [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY) and am in the process of learning the [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) layout to push that further.

### On this profile, you'll find:
*  🎓 **Academic Explorations:** Code related to my university coursework and larger projects, demonstrating concepts I've learned and applied. This sometimes includes public versions of collaborative group work (see note below).
> [!NOTE]
> For some collaborative group projects (originally developed privately), I've created separate public repositories to share and document the work more thoroughly. In these public copies, I often add detailed README sections explaining the project's context and objectives and sometimes include relevant reports or documentation for completeness.
*  💡 **Personal Tinkering:** My personal playground! These repositories contain projects I build for fun, to learn something new (currently exploring C# and Raylib!), or to solve a small problem that bugs me.

## Featured Projects 🚀

Here are some projects I'm particularly proud of or actively working on:

*   **[MazeGeneration](https://github.com/mikkn21/MazeGeneration)** - A learning tool to visualize maze generation algorithms and run multiple different algorithms side by side to see their differences.

## Coursework Highlights 🎓

*   **[The Giga Chad Compiler (Bachelor Thesis)](https://github.com/mikkn21/BachelorThesisGCC)** - Designed and implemented the Giga Chad Compiler (GCC), translating a custom language (GCL) to x86-64 Linux assembly. Features include Boost.Spirit parsing, liveness analysis, peephole optimization, and graph-coloring register allocation.
*   **[DM819-Project1](https://github.com/mikkn21/DM819Project1)** - Sweep-line algorithm for visibility problems.
*   **[DM819-Project2](https://github.com/mikkn21/DM819Project2)** - Fortune's algorithm for computing Voronoi diagrams
*   **[DM8885-ExamProject](https://github.com/mikkn21/FrontEndDevOpsProject)** - React/TypeScript frontend for a system designed to automatically test student programming assignments (Microservices/DevOps exam project).
